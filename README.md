## Overview
#### My web application is designed to help roofing companies streamline their data management and improve customer communication. It allows businesses to store, manage and access key information such as invoices, quotes, customer details and quote requests, reducing the time and effort required to create and send invoices and quotes to customers. The application also features a dashboard to easily track company progress and manage quote requests received through the company website, resulting in more efficient and effective business operations.
</br>

## Usage
This section will include installation intructions, running the app, additional resources, and deployment guides.

</br>

#### 1. Install npm packages for react-app
```
  npm install
```


#### 2. Add .env variables to root of react-app folder
```
  //Create file named .env
  touch .env
```

```
  REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=
  REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY=
```
To allow communication between the client-side and the backend, add the Supabase URL and private key to the .env file by copying them over. Supabase acts as the backend, replacing the need for a separate Node.js server.

</br>

#### 3. Start app from client folder by running this command in the terminal
```
  npm start
```
After installing the necessary packages and creating your Supabase instance, including adding the URL and Key, you can start the app by running the command. The application will be available on localhost:3000 and will prompt you to login. The login credentials can be managed in the settings of the Supabase dashboard. To ensure proper functionality, please use the provided schema for the database, including the names and fields as outlined.

</br>

#### 4. Build to docker image for deployment
```
  docker build -t my-roofing-app .  
```
</br>

#### 5. Run to docker image for deployment in port 80
```
  docker run -p 80:80 my-roofing-app
```
</br>
